Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The customer for this project was the company Driverpass they has a desire to bring a smoother way to conduct driver training and test prep by creating a online tool that will allow users to study for there drivers test as well as book inperson driver training with instructors.As well as allow the student to track their porgress.


What did you do particularly well?
I feel like my design diagrams that i created for this course are very comprehensive and well put together. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part i would look to put more time into is the information collection and compilation i feel like if i had some more face to face time with the customer to ask questions and clarify exactly what features are important to them i would be able to narrow down my system recomendations to clearly match exactly what it is that they are looking for. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The users needs are the most important part of the system design if your design doesnt meet the users needs they wont use it. This project  could have used a few more sessions for information collection because a one page document interview didnt really cut it in my oppinon. With what was provided i was able to glean the bare minimums that the company needed to meet their goals as well as some possible future improvments. 


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approch it in a logical way of breaking it down into individual accomplishable steps. I then take those challenges and attempt to complete as many as i can in the provided time frame. Usually this works as long as i have appropriatly prioritized the absolutly neccessary componentes and weighted the nice to haves lower.
